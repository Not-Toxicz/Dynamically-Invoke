# Dynamically-Invoke
Dynamicllay Invoking C# encrypted/plain text code.
It's a pretty simple concept and with a hidden private key and saltingIV, can help a lot, but backing it up with Obfuscation, will give you two levels of encryption and as long as your 'Key' and 'SaltingIV' doesn't show on DNSpy (or anyother de-compiler). If they get through your Obfuscation, they would also have to brute force both the 'Key' and 'SaltingIV'

This is the public version, I will not assist you in Cryptography. If you can't figure out text encoding, you won't be able to use this correctly.

# What does this offer to your project?
Pre-Compiled encryption ( If your key and IV ins't discoverable in DnSpy )

I can't be asked actually putting this out so Imma shit post this. (Did more than I wanted but also re-made the whole program so)

#Warning!!
Don't be a fucking skid and use this for malicious purposes.
